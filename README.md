# p100_e-commerce
This is a project on e-commerce data. Categorizing products, finding bestsellers and popular bundles.

To view all the graphs in the notebook I recommend opening the nbviewer directly. Otherwise it might not load immediatly and you won't be able to see any graphs:

**Goals of the Project**

* Categorizing our products into a managable number of categories (like kitchenwear, christmas, clothing)
* Understanding our product range and what categories are most popular
* Finding products and categories that are main assortment (often sold by themselves) and additional assortment (usually sold with products from the main range)
* Understanding seasonal changes in sales and popular categories


**These are the questions that we need to answer:**

* Which products are more often sold by themselves, and which ones are more often combined with others (main and additional assortment)?
* What product groups are more often included in the additional assortment?
* What bundles of product groups are often present in shopping carts?


**Dashboard**

Based on the processed data I also created a dashboard on TableauPublic which you can find here:
